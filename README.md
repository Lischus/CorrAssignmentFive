This is a daily planner to help with your work day! Each section of the planner represents an hour between nine o'clock in the morning to five o'clock in the evening. The gray sections are hours that have already gone by, the green sections are hours yet to come and the red section indicates the current hour. In each section you're able to type out what your plan for that day is and click the save button in order to keep it there! Even if you refresh or close the page once you go back everything will still be there as you left it!
